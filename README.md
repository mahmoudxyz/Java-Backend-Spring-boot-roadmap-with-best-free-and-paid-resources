## Sub-roadmaps
This Java developer roadmap consists of several sub-roadmaps that cover different areas of Java development. The purpose of this structure is to provide a more organized and focused approach to learning Java, so developers can focus on the areas that are most important to their goals and interests.

Each sub-roadmap covers a specific area of Java development, from core Java concepts to more advanced topics like web development and microservices. The sub-roadmaps are arranged in order of increasing complexity, with each subsequent roadmap building on the knowledge gained from the previous one.

By breaking down the Java development journey into smaller, more manageable parts, this roadmap aims to make the learning process more accessible and less overwhelming for developers. Whether you are a beginner just starting out or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this roadmap can help guide you towards your goals and provide a clear path for your professional development.
