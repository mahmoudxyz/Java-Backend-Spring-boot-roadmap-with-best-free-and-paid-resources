| **Optional**        | Lambda Expressions and Functional Programming |


### Control Statements

Control statements allow you to control the flow of a program. This includes conditional statements (if/else, switch/case) and looping statements (for, while, do-while). Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Must to learn**   | If/Else and Switch/Case               |
| **Must to learn**   | For, While, and Do-While Loops         |
| **Optional**        | Break and Continue Statements         |
| **Optional**        | Enhanced for Loop                      |


### Object-Oriented Concepts

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. Java is an object-oriented language, so it's essential to understand the concepts of OOP. This includes classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Must to learn**   | Classes and Objects                    |
| **Must to learn**   | Encapsulation and Access Modifiers     |
| **Must to learn**   | Inheritance and Polymorphism           |
| **Recommended**     | Interfaces and Abstract Classes        |
| **Recommended**     | Method Overriding and Overloading      |
| **Optional**        | Inner Classes and Anonymous Classes    |


### Exception Handling

Exception handling is the process of dealing with errors and exceptional situations in a program. Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism that enables developers to handle errors effectively. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Must to learn**   | Try, Catch, and Finally Blocks        |
| **Must to learn**   | Checked and Unchecked Exceptions      |
| **Recommended**     | Custom Exceptions                      |


### Collections

Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data. Java provides a rich set of collection classes and interfaces that make it easy to work with data collections. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Must to learn**   | List, Set, and Map Interfaces         |
| **Must to learn**   | ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector     |
| **Must to learn**   | HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet   |
| **Must to learn**   | HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap |
| **Recommended**     | Iterator and Enumeration              |
| **Recommended**     | Comparable and Comparator             |
| **Optional**        | Queue and Deque                       |
| **Optional**        | Concurrent Collections                |




### Multithreading

Multithreading is the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Java provides robust support for multithreading through its built-in Thread class and related APIs. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Recommended**     | Threads and Runnable Interface        |
| **Recommended**     | Thread Synchronization and Locking    |
| **Recommended**     | Deadlocks and Race Conditions         |
| **Optional**        | Thread Pools and Executors             |



### Generics

Generics are a powerful feature in Java that enable you to write flexible, reusable code. Generics allow you to write type-safe code that can work with a variety of data types. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Recommended**     | Generic Classes and Interfaces        |
| **Recommended**     | Wildcards and Bounded Type Parameters |
| **Optional**        | Generic Methods                       |
| **Optional**        | Type Erasure and Raw Types             |



### File Handling

File handling is the process of working with files and directories in a program. Java provides a rich set of classes and interfaces that make it easy to read, write, and manipulate files and directories. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Recommended**     | File and Directory Classes           |
| **Recommended**     | File Input and Output Streams         |
| **Recommended**     | Buffered Streams and Readers/Writers  |
| **Optional**        | NIO File Channel API                  |
