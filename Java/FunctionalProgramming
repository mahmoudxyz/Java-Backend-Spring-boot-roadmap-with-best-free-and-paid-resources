## Functional Programming in Java

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative programming. While Java is not a pure functional language, it does have several features that support functional programming. Here are some important topics and sub-topics to cover for functional programming in Java:

| Importance Level   | Topic                    | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | 
| **Must to learn**   | Lambda Expressions       |
| **Must to learn**   | Functional Interfaces    |
| **Must to learn**   | Method References        |
| **Recommended**     | Stream API and Collectors| 
| **Recommended**     | Optional                 |
| **Optional**        | Parallelism and Concurrency |

### Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions are a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 that allow you to express code as data. Lambda expressions can be used to create functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Must to learn**   | Syntax and Examples                   |
| **Must to learn**   | Functional Interfaces and Method References |
| **Recommended**     | Method and Constructor References     |
| **Optional**        | Variable Capture and Scoping           |
| **Optional**        | Method Overloading and Ambiguity       |

### Functional Interfaces

Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method. Functional interfaces can be used to create lambda expressions and method references. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Must to learn**   | Types of Functional Interfaces        |
| **Must to learn**   | Predefined Functional Interfaces      |
| **Recommended**     | Creating Custom Functional Interfaces |

### Stream API and Collectors

The Stream API is a powerful and flexible API introduced in Java 8 for processing collections of data. The Stream API allows you to express operations on data as a pipeline of operations. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Recommended**     | Creating Streams from Collections     |
| **Recommended**     | Intermediate Operations               |
| **Recommended**     | Terminal Operations                   |
| **Recommended**     | Collectors                            |
| **Optional**        | Parallel Streams                      |

### Optional

Optional is a class introduced in Java 8 that allows you to represent a value that may or may not be present. Optional can be used to avoid null pointer exceptions and to make code more readable. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Recommended**     | Creating and Using Optionals          |
| **Recommended**     | Optional API                          |
| **Optional**        | Best Practices for Using Optionals    |

### Parallelism and Concurrency

Parallelism and concurrency are important concepts in functional programming. Java has several features that support parallelism and concurrency, including the Fork/Join Framework and the java.util.concurrent package. Here are some important sub-topics to cover:

| Importance Level   | Sub-Topic                            | 
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Optional**        | Fork/Join Framework                   |
| **Optional**        | Executors and Thread Pools            |
| **Optional**        | Synchronization and Locking           |
| **Optional**        | Atomic Variables and Concurrent Maps  |
