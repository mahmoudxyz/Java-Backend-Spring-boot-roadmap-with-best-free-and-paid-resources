## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a popular framework for building production-grade, stand-alone Spring-based applications that can be easily deployed. It provides a range of features and capabilities that simplify and accelerate the development process, including auto-configuration, embedded servers, and actuator.

Auto-configuration is a key feature of Spring Boot that allows developers to avoid manual configuration of Spring projects by providing default configuration based on the dependencies included in the project. This can greatly simplify the development process and improve productivity.

Embedded servers are another important feature of Spring Boot. By default, Spring Boot includes an embedded Tomcat server, which can be easily customized and configured to meet the needs of a wide range of applications. This eliminates the need for separate installation and configuration of a separate web server, making deployment and testing much simpler.

Finally, Spring Boot's Actuator provides a range of management and monitoring capabilities for Spring-based applications, including health checks, metrics, and performance monitoring. This can greatly simplify the process of monitoring and maintaining production-grade applications, improving overall reliability and stability.
